# Assignments
Assignments are to be turned in using Canvas, on time. If you are unable to submit an assignment on time, please submit the assignment with an explanation of why you are unable to submit on time. You may share as much or as little about the circumstances as you care to. 

## Assignment Calendar (WIP)

This is the assignment calendar, and should be considered a work in progress. This "WIP" status means that we will adapt deadlines based on how quickly the class moves through the curriculum, and if we think there are other skills that we need to help you develop than we initially anticipated. For example, thus far, the preparation of this class in database technology is more consistent than in prior semesters, so we will probably not focus on that as much going forward.
