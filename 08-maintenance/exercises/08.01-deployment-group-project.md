# Spring 2019 CS4320/7320 Software Engineering
## Assignment

**THERE will be a demonstration in Thursday's Lecture** 

In this assignment, your group will get Augur Deployed on a Server. 

Instructions are available here: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/ 

You can find the repository here: https://github.com/chaoss/augur 

### Instructions
1. One person on your team will create a new fork of Augur. 
2. Grant maintain permissions on the repository *fork*. 
3. Everyone Clones Augur. 
4. Identify who on your team has access to a deployment environment. If nobody, let me know. 
5. Once everyone is familiarized with the requirements for deploying Augur, setup a 2-3 hour virtual work session with your team where you will work together to understand and deploy augur on a live server.
6. If you encounter issues, submit them here, explaining what you are doing, and what does not seem to be working: https://github.com/chaoss/augur/issues 
7. Upload a link that I can access during the week after the assignment to verify your instance is running. 
8. **IF** you do not get an instance running, submit a detailed description of what your team did, and what issues you encountered. Refer, where relevant, to specific GitHub issues you created.
